- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on realtime projects on data analysis, data engineering
- 💬 Ask me about Data Analysis and Visualization
- 📫 How to reach me: hpotnuru@iu.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have the uncanny ability to turn any dataset into a visualization masterpiece—but somehow, I still struggle to decide what to watch on Netflix! 📊🎭
